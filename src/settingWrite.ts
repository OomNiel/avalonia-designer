/* Writing a setting **where it already lives**.
 *
 * Found the hard way on 2026-09-15, after six exchanges with the user: their app project contained
 *
 *     /home/niel/Projekte/TestExtApps/OptimisedCSTest/.vscode/settings.json
 *     { "avaloniaDesigner.assistant.backend": "external" }
 *
 * — a *workspace* setting. A workspace value beats a global one, so every `backend: bundled` the panel saved to
 * Global was shadowed: the load really did work, the built-in runtime answered, and the panel — which reads the
 * *effective* value — went back to "Let the server decide…" the moment it was refreshed with a state. That is why
 * the two LM Studio models worked there (external is exactly what they need) and the two built-in ones could never
 * stick.
 *
 * Writing where the value already lives is what VS Code's own Settings UI does, and it is the only way a
 * project-level pin can be *updated* rather than argued with. A value that exists in no scope is written to the
 * user's settings, as before.
