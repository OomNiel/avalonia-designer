/* The AI section of the designer's ⚙ Settings panel — the extension half.
 *
 * Why it lives here and not in `assistantUi.ts`: this is the *designer webview's* conversation. The panel
 * renders the panel's own markup (`designerPanel.ts` holds the HTML, `media/designer.js` the behaviour),
 * and this module answers its messages: what models exist, load one, unload, run the status check, and
 * store the choices.
 *
 * The operations themselves are `localModelCore.ts` — the very same ones the Command Palette uses, so
 * "Load Model" here and "AI: Choose a Local Model…" there cannot behave differently. What is specific to
 * this file is only the *shaping* of the state the panel shows, and the fact that progress is posted to a
 * webview instead of reported in a notification.

 * The button acts on the **selection**, and the selection is frequently not a downloaded model at all: after a
 * Load the pinned value is `llama:`/`any:`, while the file behind it is one this extension downloaded itself.
 * The old code looked only at `bundled:<id>` and refused everything else with one terse sentence — no log line,
 * no trace, and a file the extension owned sitting right there. Three artefacts from that report agreed: the
 * log held no removal line for the attempt (a refusal logged nothing), `settings.json` had `backend: external`
 * with a dynamic endpoint (so the selection was a server entry) and `modelPath` pointed at the downloaded 7B
 * inside the extension's own storage.
 *
 * The rule the resolution follows is the rule deletion has always followed: **only a file inside this
 * extension's model folder is ours to delete.** Anything else — a Hugging Face cache, LM Studio's library, a
 * folder the user chose — is refused, with the reason *and* the folder we do own named, so the answer is
