/**
 * The build-driven repair loop.
 *
 * A rule-based checker can never be a compiler, so the strategy is the other way round: **the build is the
 * oracle and the rules are the hands**. Every pass runs the project's build, takes the first error that a
 * fixer understands, fixes it, and rebuilds — one error at a time, because every edit shifts line numbers
 * and can expose or erase the next error. It keeps going while it makes progress, and when it cannot fix
 * something it **skips** that error and tries the next, then hands the rest to the user as a list.
 *
 * Asked for on 2026-09-17, in these words: *"The system must check for errors by running a build when it is
 * done refactoring the code, then Code Fix must check for compile errors and fix each one, one at a time
 * untill the build is clean"* … *"Keep fixing what it can and list the rest."*
 *
 * Deliberately free of `vscode` and of any file access: everything that touches the project (building,
 * applying a fix, reverting, showing progress, cancelling) is injected. That is what makes the pass logic —
 * the progress guard, the revert and the termination rules — testable without a compiler or a window.
