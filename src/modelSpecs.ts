 * these exact files (checked 2026-09-14), and the sidecar refuses a file that does not match.
 *
 * Why a code-specialised model and not Phi-3-mini (the original guess, see NOTES.md §91): Microsoft's

 * WHY TWO, AND WHY THIS PAIR. *"We know the Qwen 7B answered correctly and that it should be a Vulkan build.
 * There should only be 2 options in the picker, the Qwen 7B built with Vulkan and the 7B build without
 * Vulkan."* Measured on this machine with the application's own prompt — the ComboBox → grid-row handler, with
 * the DataSet facts block in it (NOTES.md §132, §134):
 *
 *   - the **7B** wrote the only answer that compiles (`CustomersDataSet.Customers.FirstOrDefault(row =>
 *     row.Name == selectedName)`), in **9.7 s on the Vulkan build** and 13.0 s on the CPU one;
 *   - the 3B was quickest and wrong — `DataTable.Rows.Find(predicate)`, and `Find` takes a key, not a predicate;
 *   - DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite wrote `DataGrid1.Items` — the `CS1061` failure 0.10.2 was about — *while the
 *     prompt told it that member does not exist*;
 *   - Gemma-4-Coder 12B answered nothing at all through the OpenAI path (its chat template).
 *
 * So the choice a novice actually faces is not "which model" but **"use the GPU or not"**, and it is offered as
 * two entries over one download: the weights are fetched and verified once, and the only difference is which
 * native build of llama.cpp runs them. `backend` is what makes an entry mean something — the Load path writes
 * it to `assistant.bundledBackend`, the same key the status line reads back, so "which build actually loaded"
 * is never a guess. A Vulkan load that dies is retried on the CPU build (`sidecarAttempts`), and the panel says
 * so.
 *
 * THE STEP UP IS NOT A THIRD ENTRY. When a repair run ends without a clean build, the extension *offers* the
 * user's own big model — *"the system must ask the user if it should re-try a fix with the 30B model"* — and
 * `bigModel.ts` is that path.
