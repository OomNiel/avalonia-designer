/**
 * The AI assist's prompt, written **where the work is** — in the editor, at the caret.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (asked 2026-09-18): *"place the prompt input box next to the current cursor position and make
 * the prompt entry box a multi-line (at least 5 lines) input area"*. Neither half is possible with the prompt
 * widget the extension used until then: `vscode.window.showInputBox` is single-line by design (`InputBoxOptions`
 * has `value`, `valueSelection`, `prompt`, `placeHolder` — no `multiline`, no `rows`), and VS Code always draws
 * it at the top of the window; there is no API to anchor it at the caret. The Comments API is not an alternative
 * either: a `CommentThread` has `canReply` and a `label`, but no `input` and no submit event, so a reply typed
 * into one goes nowhere an extension can read (checked against the shipped `@types/vscode`, 2026-09-18).
 *
 * So the editor itself is the input. `AI: Implement in Function…` inserts a *marker block* at the caret:
 *
 *     // ✎ AI: begin — write what you want below, as many lines as you like
 *     |
 *     // ✎ AI: end
 *
 * the caret is placed between the two markers (`$0` in the snippet, so it is where the user is already looking),
 * and the two commands a code lens offers — **Send to AI assist** and **Cancel** — read the block, remove it, and
 * hand the text to the same flow the single-line box used to feed. That gives the request what the dialog could
 * not: the caret's own position, as many lines as the user needs, `Ctrl+Z` to abandon it, and no length limit
 * that has to be guessed before typing starts.
 *
 * Everything here is pure text handling — the module imports nothing — so the parsing, the prefix per language
 * and the "leave the file exactly as it was" property are all pinned by the suite rather than by a screenshot.
